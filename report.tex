\section{Validation of Forward Model}

The forward model computes from a set of ocean and atmosphere parameters the brightness temperatures expected to be measured by a satellite radiometer. The input parameters are listed in Table \ref{tab:input_parameters}, and the output parameters include values for both horizontal and vertical polarization at \SI{6.93}{GHz}, \SI{10.65}{GHz}, \SI{18.70}{GHz}, \SI{23.80}{GHz}, and \SI{36.50}{GHz}.

This forward model was validated by comparing its results to reference data from ESA's ``Sea Ice Climate Change Initiative''.



\subsection{Description of the Reference Data}

The reference data consists of brightness temperatures at the relevant polarizations and frequencies as measured by the AMSR2 radiometer onboard the GCOM-W1 satellite. %for a range of geocoded locations at a given time.
The measured data is paired with validated sea ice concentrations and numerical weather predictions for the atmospheric and oceanic parameters at the same geocoded locations at near simultaneous time. There are two different data sets: one with an ice concentration of 0, the other one with an ice concentration of 1. When using this reference data package to validate the forward model, several points have to be taken into account:
\newline

Firstly, the forward model was developed for the AMSR-E instrument. By using the atmospheric and oceanic parameters as input in the forward model in order to compare the output with the AMSR2 measured brightness temperatures, we assume that any calibration differences between AMSR-E and AMSR2 are negligible. % Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) 
%The AMSR-E instrument on the NASA satellite EOS Aqua was operational between May 4, 2002 and October 4, 2011, and the AMSR2 instrument mounted on the JAXA satellite GCOM-W1, has been in operation since May 18, 2012. 
\newline

Secondly, the reference data does not contain information about the multi-year ice fraction needed as input in the forward model. %The multi-year ice fraction cannot be found in the reference data and should therefore be determined by other means. The reference data is divided into two parts, one contains only datapoints from areas of open water for which the ice concentration is zero in which case
For the data set with an ice concentration of 0, the MY fraction is irrelevant. It is therefore possible to validate the forward model for the open water datapoints. For the data set with an ice concentration of 1, %The other part of the reference data contain datapoints from areas of high ice concentration for which the MY fraction is unknown. 
a multi-year ice concentration of 0.5 was found to produce reasonable outputs of the forward model. This dataset can therefore be used as a coherency check, but not to validate the model.
%We will still attempt to test the forward model for the high ice concentration areas by making an estimate of the MY fraction through a process of trial and error. The idea is to select a location where we have prior information about the MY fraction(...).
\newline

Thirdly, the wind speed is given in the %NWP
reference data as a u-component, v-component, and as a composite of the two. %(comment/question: where u and v denote zonal and meridional directions respectively?)
To simplify the validation procedure, we used the composite value for the wind speed as the input in the forward model. %(Argumentation!?) (-backscatter as a result of wind speed direction (upwind, downwind, crosswind) sensitive to azimuth angle \cite{Elachi})
\newline

%In order to use the reference data in the forward model it was necesarry to perform unit conversions for 
The parameters ``water vapour'' and ``cloud liquid water'', which are given in the columnar units of $\SI{}{kg/m^2}$ in the reference data, were converted to $\SI{}{mm}$, indicating the height of water vapor or cloud liquid water if condensed uniformly across the column. $\SI{1}{kg/m^2}$ corresponds to $\SI{1}{mm}$ \cite{remss}.


\subsection{Validation Procedure}

For the data set with an ice concentration of 0, the atmospheric and oceanic parameters were entered into the forward model, and the difference of the modelled brightness temperatures with respect to the reference data was recorded. The reference file has 6987 data points, all of which were used. For the data set with an ice concentration of 1, the atmospheric and oceanic parameters were entered together with a guessed value for the multi-year ice fraction. This value was chosen to be constant for all datapoints to simplify the validation process. To save computation time, only the first 1000 data points were used.


\subsection{Validation Results}

The discrepancies for the no ice condition are shown in Figure \ref{fig:for0}, and those for the ice condition are shown in Figure \ref{fig:for1}. Later in this report, the forward model will be used to develop an estimation of the impact a certain discrepancy in brightness temperature has on the modelled atmospheric and oceanic parameters.

   \caption{Distribution of the errors of the modelled brightness temperatures compared to the no ice dataset; only some channels are shown}
   \label{fig:for1dist}
\end{figure}

For the no ice condition, the discrepancies in channels 10.65 h, 18.70 v and h, 23.80 h, and 36.50 h exceed \(\pm\)\SI{50}{K}. A histogram of the error distribution of these channels was plotted, see \mbox{Figure \ref{fig:for1dist}}. The modelled brightness temperatures appear to have an offset of approx. \SI{-8}{K}, with a tendency to a higher offset for the higher frequencies. For the channels 10.65 h and 18.70 v, \SI{90}{\percent} of the errors lie within \(\pm\)\SI{10}{K} off the offset (mean error) of that channel. For the channels 18.70 v and 23.80 h, \SI{90}{\percent} of the errors lie within \(\pm\)\SI{20}{K} off the offset, and for the channel 36.50 h, \SI{90}{\percent} of the errors lie within \(\pm\)\SI{30}{K} off the offset.
\newline

The absolute error of the modelled data compared to the dataset with an ice concentration of 1 appears smaller than for the comparison to the dataset with the no ice condition. However, the minimization of this error was used as the criterion to find the best guess for the multi-year ice concentration. It is therefore not feasible to use this set of errors as a means of describing the accuracy of the forward model.
